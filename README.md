# TabletopHax
I have decided to release one of my CIL injections to the public.
This project is very simple, and It is based on my Patcher work in Notulp/Fougerite.

# Installation
* Copy the latest game dlls where the patcher.exe file is. (Assembly, Unity)
* Run the patcher
* Once finished copy the DLCDreTaX.dll and the Patched Assembly to the game directory.
* Only the host needs the Patched files, the people who join your server will have fake information of your DLCs, so they can also play with you.
